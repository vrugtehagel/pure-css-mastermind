# Pure CSS Mastermind

Try it at [vrugtehagel.nl/mastermind](https://vrugtehagel.nl/mastermind)!

This is somewhat of a sequel to my [pure CSS calculator](https://github.com/vrugtehagel/pure-css-calculator/). I wanted to do something showing off the power of CSS while also being a bit more fun than a calculator. So, this version of Mastermind was born.

It's a bit more polished than the calculator, but the code is still spaghetti because using only HTML and CSS to write a functional page is not generally a maintainable way of doing things.

Also, accessibility was basically thrown out the window. It works only for users with perfect vision. Not very inclusive of me, I know...

Anyway, enjoy!
